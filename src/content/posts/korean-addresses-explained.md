## Translating between Korean and English
| Korean | English gloss | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| -도  | -do    | Province |
| -구  | -gu    | District |
| -시  | -si    | City |

## Anatomy of an Address
In the US, an example address looks like this:
<figure>
	1234 Tree Road
	Apt 201
	City, State 11111
</figure>

In South Korea, this would instead look like this, with the zip code omitted[^1]:

[^1]: (Korean zip codes are not used for identifying location, just for postal purposes. Well, that's also true in the US too!)

<figure>
	State, City, Tree Road 1234
</figure>

Note that the Korean address goes from logically "largest to smallest" - State > City > Road > Building/Block.

However, Korea doesn't have states, it has provinces and districts! So a Korean address would actually look more like this:

<figure>
	Province, District, City, Tree Road 1234 Apt 201
</figure>

## The "Small Part"
Let's now ignore Province, District, and City -- in the US you can often skip those and just input a street number and street name into Google Maps and, since that is likely fairly unique in the area, it will find the right result. The same is true in Korea.


While in the US the street numbers are often 3-5 digits long, in korea they are often only 1-3 digits, so let's pick a new example address:

<figure>
	Lake Drive 12
</figure>

In America, there are often addresses with multiple Suite numbers, and apartment units typically share a single address and have Apt or Unit numbers.

This is even more common in Korean cities since they are dense, and large apartment buildings are much more common.

| Korean | English gloss | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| -x  | -x    | Building |
| -x  | -x    | Room |



## Understanding the System with English-only Example
Let's zoom in on just the *street* address, and ignore province, district, and city.






## Reading actual addresses
### Osan
Let's start with <ruby>오산시<rt>Osan</rt></ruby>, and then get into a more urban environment like Seoul later.
