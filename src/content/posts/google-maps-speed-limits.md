I usually rely on Google Maps to view the speed limit while I'm driving. After all, speed limit signs aren't posted everywhere so sometimes I don't see it for a few seconds.

However there's some flaws to this:

- If I happen to be driving without Google Maps and want to check the speed limit, I have to wait until the next speed limit sign, or I have to know what the speed limit is in this area or on this kind of road.
- Even if Google Maps is on, it doesn't know about school zones or when one is in effect, so Google Maps is wrong about the speed limit. Fortunately school zones signs are usually very visible.
- This also applies to other temporary speed limit reductions like when there's road work.

What legal and ethical responsibility should Google the company bear to keep this as accurate as possible for traffic safety purposes?

Well, legally, they just wave if off in their [Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/help/terms_maps/):

> **Actual Conditions; Assumption of Risk.** When you use Google Maps/Google Earth's map data, traffic, directions, and other content, you may find that actual conditions differ from the map results and content, so exercise your independent judgment and use Google Maps/Google Earth at your own risk. Youâ€™re responsible at all times for your conduct and its consequences.

But ethically? I dunno. This whole thing reminds me of [this performance art piece](https://www.simonweckert.com/googlemapshacks.html) about the power Google Maps has on our physical reality.
