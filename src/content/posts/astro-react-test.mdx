import { ColorChanger } from '../../components/ColorChanger.tsx'
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import img1 from '../../../public/astro-react-test-1.png'

Testing an Astro React component with useState.

<ColorChanger client:visible initialColor='#ffa500' />

How slow is this? How much Javascript ships in the build?

<Image loading='eager' src={img1} alt="Screenshot of the network tab of this blog post" />

So it's about a 2025% (raw) or 1475% (compressed, transferred) increase in size, for my very simple component.
