import { ColorChanger } from '../../components/ColorChanger.tsx'
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import img1 from '../../../public/astro-react-test-1.png'

Testing an Astro React component with useState.

<ColorChanger client:visible initialColor='#ffa500' />

How slow is this? How much Javascript ships in the build?

<Image loading='eager' src={img1} alt="Screenshot of the network tab of this blog post" />

So it's about a 2025% (raw) or 1475% (compressed, transferred) increase in size, for my very simple component.

What about build times and sizes?

Overall, would use React again if neede, but by default happy to keep making posts without it.
